# PostgreSQL Practice Assignment

This practice assignment is designed to help you practice various PostgreSQL clauses, constraints, joins, subqueries, and aggregations using the provided database schema.

## Database Schema

The database schema for this assignment consists of the following tables:

- titles: stores the different titles available for employees.
- employees: stores employee information, including their titles and managers.
- teams: stores team information, including team names and locations.
- projects: stores project information, including project names, clients, start dates, deadlines, and project managers.
- team_project: a joining table for the many-to-many relationship between teams and projects.
- hour_tracking: tracks the total working hours of employees on various projects, including employee_id, project_id, total_hours

## Requirements

Write the queries to perform these following actions:

- Create database with all tables with the neccessary properties and relationships (file `createDatabase.sql`)

In file `retrieval.sql`, provide the following querries:

- Retrieve the team names and their corresponding project count.
- Retrieve the projects managed by the managers whose first name starts with "J" or "D".
- Retrieve all the employees (both directly and indirectly) working under Andrew Martin
- Retrieve all the employees (both directly and indirectly) working under Robert Brown
- Retrieve the average hourly salary for each title.
- Retrieve the employees who have a higher hourly salary than their respective team's average hourly salary.
- Retrieve the projects that have more than 3 teams assigned to them.
- Retrieve the total hourly salary expense for each team.

In file `functions.sql`, provide the functions:

- Create a function `track_working_hours(employee_id, project_id, total_hours)` to insert data into the hour_tracking table to track the working hours for each employee on specific projects. Make sure that data need to be validated before the insertion. Test this function

```
SELECT track_working_hours(20, 7, 40.5);
SELECT track_working_hours(23, 7, 32.25);
SELECT track_working_hours(12, 7, 22.75);
-- and so on...
```

- Create a function `create_project_with_teams` to create a project and assign teams to that project simultaneously. Test this function

```
SELECT create_project_with_teams(
    'New Project',
    'Client XYZ',
    '2023-07-01',
    '2023-12-31',
    ARRAY[1, 2, 3]
);
```
